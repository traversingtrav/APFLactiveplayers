database search for all active players

This is my first node js application. It's designed specifically to allow team managers to search all active pleayers.
It also allow the league manager to easily update active players and player abilities in the database.
Please reach out with any insight on how to add more functionality to this app.
The next goal would be how to have this app store other stats in the data base to be displayed on a second page.
Then have active player move to another database as they retire.
